My collection of small Perl scripts for text (and not only) processing.

Currently only features lblmp, which is kinda a replacement for unix pipes.
Just type anything you want and then if you want to process everything
you written above just type ‘#!! your fancy processing command’. What you
written will be passed to your fancy processing command through standart
input, and anything retreived from standart output afterwards will replace
you document.

Example:

    I want this
    to be
    cool.
    #!! /usr/bin/sed s/cool/C00L/g

Results in

    I want this
    to be
    C00L.
